Hydra-Express is a light-weight library for building NodeJS and ExpressJS based distributed computing applications. It was announced at [EmpireNode 2016](http://empirenode.org/).

A key goal in Hydra-Express is to simplify building Node-based distributed applications.

There's a Hydra-express tutorial on the [RisingStack community site](https://community.risingstack.com/tutorial-building-expressjs-based-microservices-using-hydra/). Rather watch a video than read the docs? See our [Introduction to Hydra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHFQxrc4Fnk) video on YouTube.

> Hydra-Express replies on an instance of Redis, if you need to learn more about Redis, see our [Redis quick start guide](https://youtu.be/eX7EamF_WuA).
